# CSM - Optimized Streaming/Finetuning Edition

---

CSM (Conversational Speech Model) is a speech generation model from [Sesame](https://www.sesame.com) that generates RVQ audio codes from text and audio inputs. The model architecture employs a [Llama](https://www.llama.com/) backbone and a smaller audio decoder that produces [Mimi](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/mimi) audio codes.

Our fork adds **api**, **websocker** and **docker** to the [csm-streaming](https://github.com/davidbrowne17/csm-streaming) fork.

## üöÄ Additional Features in This Fork

- ‚úÖ **REST API with FastAPI**  
  Easily generate speech via `/speak` endpoint using JSON requests.
- üîê **API Key Authentication**  
  Secure access to the API using `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header.
- üê≥ **Docker & Docker Compose Support**  
  Fully containerized setup with GPU access, Hugging Face token, and environment configuration.
- üóÇÔ∏è **OpenAPI schema**  
  Visit `/docs` for Swagger UI or `/openapi.json` for raw schema.

## üìò Usage Documentation

The project includes a complete Docker setup located in the `Docker` folder with:

- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yaml`
- `.env`

When you run it using Docker Compose, it will:
- Automatically start the FastAPI server with Uvicorn
- Expose the API on `http://127.0.0.1:5537`
- Serve the interactive Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:5537/docs`

You can access the OpenAPI schema and test endpoints from your browser.

### üõ† Docker Setup Notes

Before starting, make sure to configure your `.env` file with these environment variables:

```env
BUILD_VERSION=0013
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_000000
NO_TORCH_COMPILE=1
CSM_API_KEY=csmapikey_000000
```
‚úÖ Important:
- Replace hf_000000 with your actual Hugging Face token to access the required models.
- Replace csmapikey_000000 with a secure random key. This will be used for authenticating API requests.
